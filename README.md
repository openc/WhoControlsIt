## Who Controls It

This is a proof-of-concept Beneficial Ownership register to demonstrate how data could be collected. It was designed in less than a couple of days by OpenCorporates to help inform UK Civil Society's response to the  [UK government's consultation](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/367578/bis-14-1145-the-register-of-people-with-significant-control-psc-register-register-final-1.pdf) on what the Beneficial Ownership register (or register of Persons of Significant Control) will look like. Beneficial owners are the individuals who ultimately control companies, together with the means/route of control.

We will be iterating and improving it over time, and believe it can be developed into an open data global beneficial ownership database. Before then there's a lot to do, but first here's the site in a nutshell:

* Allows company owners to self-submit that they control companies, using [OpenCorporates API](https://api.opencorporates.com/) to search for the companies
* Allow third-parties to add BO data for companies they add based on official filings
* Allows evidentiary filings to be uploaded (uses S3)
* List companies added, and allow to be searched by 'live-search'
* Show control graphs on controlling persons page
* Pulls in data on the company from the OpenCorporates
* Deployed to alpha.WhoControlsIt.com using dummy data


### Think you can improve **Who Controls it**? Here's how
This software is open-source, and we welcome contributors to improve it, both on the back-end and on the UI too. The application is coded in [Ruby On Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), but there is plenty to help with, even if you aren't a Ruby coder (front end development, documentation, etc)

#### Requirements for running in development:
* Ruby 2.1.2
* Sqlite


####Installing on your local development machine:
    git clone https://github.com/openc/WhoControlsIt.git
	cd whocontrolsit
	bundle
	bundle exec rake db:migrate
	bundle exec rake db:seed # to add seed data
	rails s #to start a server, accessible at localhost:3000

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

### Updating the jurisdiction list

Jurisdictions are taken from opencorporates. To update to the latest jurisdictions:

rake countries:import_countries

####Things that need adding:
* Design
* Write test suite (rspec)
* Add relationships for other types of control
* Add more complex networks (bi-furcated etc)
* Make UI smoother, more ajaxy/sexy
